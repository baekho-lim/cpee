    "description_1": "Many entrepreneurship programs have focused on explaining successful outcomes or presenting strategies that appear to be the right answers. But in reality, entrepreneurs must always make decisions with incomplete information, limited resources, and conflicting values.",
    "description_2": "CPEE focuses on exactly that point. The ability to explain why you made a choice, rather than what is right. Standards that can last, rather than rapid growth. Structures where trust and responsibility accumulate, rather than short-term results.",
    "description_3": "CPEE is not a lecture-centered institution but a learning community that shares experiences and reflects. It is a space where mentors and participants jointly review decisions made from their respective positions and design the next choice in a better direction.",
